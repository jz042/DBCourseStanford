Working files for the Stanford database mini-courses

I created this file because the course discussion forum was quite unuseful. I'm sharing my solutions to the exercises in case anyone else, like me, would like a bit more help in terms of looking at example solution as they work through the courses.

Since you are taking these courses on your own accord, obviously you should still be figuring out the solution by yourself instead of copying and pasting.

I'm also pretty sure my solutions are not the best. Please feel free to share if you have better answers.
